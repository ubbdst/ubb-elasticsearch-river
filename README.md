ubb-elasticsearch-river
=======================

UBB ElasticSearch River Plugin (ubb-elasticsearch-river) is in the initial stage of developments but at the end, the plugin will be able to do the following:-

<br>
•	Harvest RDF data locally from Jena TDB using SPARQL queries
<br>
•	Create a graph (model) based on the data retrieved from Jena TDB
<br>
•	Represent such a graph in JSON-LD format
<br>
•	Manipulate JSON-LD data (the way we want) before indexing to ElasticSearch
<br>
•	Bulk index the data to ElasticSearch
<br>

The plugin borrows some functionalities from ElasticSearch rdf river plugin that can be found here: https://github.com/eea/eea.elasticsearch.river.rdf

Information about installation, usage and configuration are to follow.
